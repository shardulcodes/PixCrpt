# Stego Tool – Encrypt & Decrypt Utility

## Overview

Stego Tool is a Flask-based application designed for secure encryption, decryption, and steganographic analysis of images.  
It integrates advanced Linux-based utilities to provide a comprehensive solution for digital forensics, CTF challenges, and data security workflows.

## Features

- **Encrypt & Decrypt** text or files using secure cryptographic methods.
- **Image Steganography Analysis** using tools like:
  - `exiftool`
  - `steghide`
  - `strings`
  - `binwalk`
- **User-Friendly Interface** built with Flask templates.
- **Modular Code Structure** for easy expansion.
- **Cross-Platform Support** (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL).

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Tools:** exiftool, steghide, strings, binwalk
- **Platform:** WSL / Linux-based execution
